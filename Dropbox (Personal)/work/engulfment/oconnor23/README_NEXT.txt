# MESA: Simulating planetary engulfment in evolved stars

Extensions to Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics used to simulate 
the orbital evolution of an engulfed planet and the hydrodynamical response 
of the stellar envelope in a coupled manner. 

To use this extension, you need to have already installed MESA >r21.12.1. 
The authors of the paper used r22.05.1.
